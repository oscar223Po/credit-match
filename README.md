# 💳 CreditMatch — Smart Loan Finder Platform

This project showcases the development of a fully responsive and high-performance loan-matching platform designed for CreditMatch. The website was built to help users find the best loan offers from over 200 trusted lenders within minutes. My work focused on creating a clean, intuitive interface and implementing a structured frontend architecture that ensures seamless navigation and fast loading times. I developed custom components for loan comparison, integrated dynamic content blocks, and optimized the site for accessibility and mobile use.
